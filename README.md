```



### Quick Install Script
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pavlovic265/265-gt/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Build from Source (For Developers)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pavlovic265/265-gt.git
cd 265-gt

# Build the binary
go build -o gt main.go

# Install to your PATH (choose one):
# Option 1: User directory (no sudo needed)
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv gt ~/.local/bin/
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Option 2: System directory (requires sudo)
sudo mv gt /usr/local/bin/
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Initialize Configuration**
   ```bash
   gt config global
   ```

2. **Add your first account**
   ```bash
   gt account add
   ```

3. **Authenticate with your Git platform**
   ```bash
   gt auth login
   ```

4. **Start using gt commands**
   ```bash
   gt create feature-branch    # Create and switch to a new branch
   gt up                       # Move up in branch stack
   gt down                     # Move down in branch stack
   ```

## 🔄 Git Pass-Through

**gt** automatically passes unknown commands to git, so you can use any git command through gt:

```bash
# These all work seamlessly
gt log --oneline -5
gt branch --list
gt diff --name-only
gt status
gt add .
gt commit -m "My commit"
```

When an unknown command is used, gt will show:
```
Unknown command, passing to git: git [command]
[git output]
```

This means you can use gt as a drop-in replacement for git while getting the benefits of gt's enhanced commands.
